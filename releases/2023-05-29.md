# Release: May 29, 2023

## ðŸš€ Workspaces

We just released a major overhaul of how we manage Github organizations & accounts. We now require all Github organizations be grouped into workspaces. This opens the door for future features that have been requested by you! See the highlights below (plus some future features that are now possible):

*   Group multiple Github Organizations into one entity
*   Separate personal Accounts from company Github Organizations
*   Allow user to set active workspace on sign-up
*   *(FUTURE)*: Allow for cross Github Org tagging
*   *(FUTURE)*: Workspace based analytics (view/read a document)

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** As an end user if you are already associated with a Github Org you will NOT be required to create a workspace, this only happens during initial onboarding.

## ðŸ›‘ Breaking Changes

You are now required to set an active workspace, this means the first time you log-in you will be required to set the active workspace.

You can set the active workspace in the Setting portion of the application:

*   âœ¨ Improved Algorithm for detecting out-of-date documents
