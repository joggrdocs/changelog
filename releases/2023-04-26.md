# Release: April 26, 2023

## ‚úç New Document Editor (WYSIWYG)

Our latest release includes a **major** overhaul to the editor. Our previous editor was to a certain degree nothing more than a code editor built for markdown. We rebuilt our editor from the ground up, providing not only a better editing experience but a ton of new features, a few of which are listed below.

*   Improved Code Snippets
*   Support for Tables
*   Command Palette (type `/` and you will see it open!)
*   Mermaid live editor
*   Markdown-like styling

## üìΩ Loom Video

See the loom video below for a walkthrough of the new features.
