## ✨ Generation of Documents *(alpha)*

We can now generate entire documents for you! You now have the ability to generate documents based on your own internal source code. This allows you to have a great starting point when you are writing complex How-to Guides or you want to knock out a quick How-to guide without having to add the cognitive load of writing documentation.

Take a look at the video below to learn more:

**ALPHA**: Generating a document is currently in *alpha* and will be under constant development over the next couple of weeks.

## ✨ Generate descriptions for **Code Snippets**

You can now generate a detailed description for a Code Snippet that was added to a document. This allows you to focus on making sure the example code is what you need, and let Joggr make sure that your code is easily understood by the reader of the documentation you are creating.
